### Hi there 👋 🇧🇷

<!--
**PauloSpiguel/PauloSpiguel** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.--!>

My name is Paulo Spiguel from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2015 and currently I'm Developer at [GBSN Research](https://gbsnresearch.com). I'm passionate about projects that can make people's lives easier. I love to study and I like to learn, I feel that one day I'll be part of something great that could improve the world in some way.

In my free time, I like to play (and watch) football (⚽️ ), watch movies (🎞️ ) and series (📺 ), read books (📚 ), listen to music (🎵) and I like to walk and observe the details of people and admire the beauty of this world, I am a Christian and also a little scientist, so I like to philosophize about life with a guarana (🥤).

One of my biggest dreams is to be fluent in English and self-sufficient in my work.
